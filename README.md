# python-dutchcharts
Web scraping script for dutch charts website.

This Python script scraps the website of Dutch music charts and saves the chartrun of records from the list to CSV file. It can read the name of the record and chart position for every week it charted. I used this script for many countries (with minor modifications because of country specificity) and finally collected the great database of chart performances of Dieter Bohlen and Thomas Anders from 14 countries. I would like to show it to the world as soon I get more familiar with data visualisation!
At the moment you can see the snippet of my chart analysis on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arczyn/viz/Ready-GSAvsrestoftheworld/GSAandtherestoftheworld (this dashboard shows the analysis of single charts in GSA and non-GSA region).
